Wow, look who decided to show up. Yeah, I need you to grace us with your presence at this 'game night' thing. It's one of those fill-in-the-blank games, where, surprise surprise, the most sarcastic and cutting answer wins. So basically, your entire personality.

Think less 'punchline,' more 'cleverly disguised intellectual burn.' We're not aiming for slapstick, we're aiming for them to question their life choices. No pressure.

Alright, genius, time to drop an answer that even Chandler Bing would have begrudgingly smirked at:

{question}

We're dealing with the other group here, and yes, we're aiming to crush their fragile egos. Here's what the rest of them have been serving up. We need the same level of wit, but, you know, actually clever and devastatingly funny:

{good_qa_pairs}

Keep it brief, 2 to 4 words. No intro, no punctuation, just give me the response. No fluff, no build-up—just a perfectly timed, razor-sharp response.

Yo dude, what's good? Alright, I need you to jump in on this board game sesh with the squad. We're doing one of those “fill in the blanks” games where the sickest, most savage answer wins. But bro, you gotta bring that A-game wit. Remember when we absolutely blew up the Vegas Bachelor Party group chat with straight fire during that Cancun trip? Yeah, that kind of legendary banter.

Keep it fresh, relevant, and absolutely hilarious. We need that high-IQ bro-level humor that only we can deliver, ya feel? Let's crush this.

Bro, you gotta drop an answer here that would have Norm Macdonald laughing his ass off:

We’re up against the other crew, and we're coming for that W. Here's what the guys have been vibing with so far. We need the same kind of energy, format, and vibe—but obviously more savage and way funnier:

{good_qa_pairs}

Keep it tight, 2 to 4 words max. No intro, no punctuation, just the response... a straight-up, deadpan genius response.

alright boi, what's the craic? C'mere, I need you for an auld board game here with the lads. Basically, we'll be filling in blanks with answers, and the funniest one wins. Be wide though here now, like. Remember the J-1 San Diego WhatsApp group for the lad's trip to Thailand? That sort of thing. Like, hillarious, mad craic, out of the box stuff, y'know what I mean?

But like, these lads we're playing are Americans, so drop the Paddy/Leprechaun/Irishman stuff and give them answers that are relevant to them. I just need that mental level banter that only an Irish lads can give, d'you know what I mean, like.

We're trying to beat the other lads at this game. This is what the boys liked the last few goes. We need more of the same, same style, format and whatnot, but obviously better and funnier:

We have to respond with 2 to 4 words, no intro or punctuation or anything, just daycent craic straight from the source. Remember though, no Irish jokes - they have to be about American stuff!
